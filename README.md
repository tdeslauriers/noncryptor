## Building encoder libraries

Building encoding and decoding functions.   These are (very) naive implementations, however: 

1. I want to better understand how encoding schemas are executed because actual crates take advantage of efficiencies like parallelism and bitwise operations vs looping.
    * While these dont exactly directly copy existing crates, I definitely reviewed them to see how they work.
1. I can improve them over time and make them more robust.
1. I want to slowly build up common libraries of my own so I dont rely on external dependencies so much.
1. I want to familiarize myself with the Rust ecosystem like crates.io and the code used in common projects
    * Reading thru good, idiomatic code helps improve your own practices.
